    Overview: This repository contains the assignment and documentation for my TouchDesigner project. My project is an experience that has multiple interactive elements. In the background, it generates an ASCII art background based on your webcam feed. Then overlaying Matrix-Inspired falling text that dynamically changes as it descends. Finally, it features an audio-reactive static circle in relation to my microphone.
