It looks like you're trying to create an HTML document, but there might be a couple of issues with your code. Here are some suggestions:

Add a space after the <h1> tag: Ensure there's a space between the opening <h1> tag and the text within it.

Wrap text in <p> tags: If you want to include text paragraphs, make sure they're wrapped in <p> tags.

Link Formatting: If you're trying to include a link, make sure it's properly formatted using the <a> tag.

Here's your code with these adjustments:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>TouchDesigner Interactive Assignment </title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>

ðŸ‘¾ Live in the Matrix ðŸ‘¾ 

</h1>
<p> 
    Overview: This repository contains the assignment and documentation for my TouchDesigner project. My project is an experience that has multiple interactive elements. In the background, it generates an ASCII art background based on your webcam feed. Then overlaying Matrix-Inspired falling text that dynamically changes as it descends. Finally, it features an audio-reactive static circle in relation to my microphone.
